getwriter,"As demand for enterprise AI grows, scaling language models face challenges: diminishing returns, limited public data, high energy needs, and chip constraints. At Writer, we believe the future lies in precision training and architectural innovation.

When we announced that our Palmyra x 004 model topped the tool calling leaderboards built on purely synthetic data, we realized there were a lot of myths surrounding synthetic data.

Misconceptions hinder adoption. Our Co-Founder and CTO Waseem Alshikh shares the facts and debunks these four prevalent myths:⁠

❌ Poor quality: Synthetic data isn't inferior — it can match or even surpass real data when generated correctly.

❌ ""Fake"" or hallucinated data: Synthetic data isn't fabricated — it's meticulously crafted off real data to mirror real-world scenarios.

❌ Can’t exclusively train on synthetic data: With the right bias and accuracy mitigation strategies, models can be trained solely on synthetic data, achieving remarkable performance and efficiency.

❌ Significant risks and ethical concerns: Synthetic data poses no more risks than real data and offers greater control and privacy.

Armed with facts, leaders can confidently embrace synthetic data to drive their AI initiatives forward.

getwriter,"The one slide that every executive I met wanted to double click into at CES....

What makes agents different than the AI app or copilot of last year?

They can self-orchestrate.

If you give them a goal they can reference available components and come up with the necessary sequence of steps to solve it.

Except, we know first-hand how complex enterprise workflows are — we're reinventing them alongside our customers at Writer.

They're SO complex that even the executives, mangers, and teams at those companies can have a hard time articulating exactly what goes into them.

Anyone telling you agents are going to be able to understand these workflows on the fly doesn't actually understand this complexity.

You mostly DON'T want your AI agents totally self-orchestrating.

Today to see real ROI with AI agents you need CONTROLS. You need a design pattern that can capture the nuanced way your teams work so that your agents can plug in and assist with your mission critical workflows.

You need orchestration.

An orchestration layer that can help guide agents — to the right AI app with business logic, to the right tools you need to interact with your systems and data, and to the right people to approve, monitor, and contribute.

AND YET — the technology alone is not enough.

You need the expertise in the actual complexity of the workflow.

getwriter,"As I’m sure everyone has been shouting from the rooftops, “2025 is the year of AI agents!”. But let’s be real—most of what’s being said is vague, high-level fluff that sounds impressive but tells you nothing useful. So, let’s cut through the noise and talk about the actual levels and details of LLM agents—because not all agents are created equal, and no, they’re not magical AI fairies that solve everything.
Here’s a breakdown of LLM agent types (without the buzzword salad):

1️⃣ Basic LLM Agents
📌 For when you just need a no-drama, straightforward solution.
What they do: Take a simple input, spit out a coherent response. That’s it.
Use Cases:
- Writing emails or blogs.
- Answering simple questions.
Example: Ask it to draft a blog about AI in healthcare, and boom—you’ve got a passable first draft. Easy peasy.

2️⃣ CoT Agents (Chain of Thought)
📌 The overthinkers of the AI world.
What they do: Break down complex tasks into logical, step-by-step reasoning. Great for when you need the ""how"" behind the answer.
Use Cases:
- Analyzing legal docs.
- Solving multi-step math problems.
Example: Reviewing a legal contract clause by clause and telling you why you probably shouldn’t sign it.

3️⃣ RAG Agents (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
📌 Because sometimes, even AI needs to Google things.
What they do: Fetch relevant information from external sources and combine it with generative capabilities.
Use Cases:
- Personalized customer support.
- Knowledge management.
Example: Pulling up medical research on a rare disease and generating a detailed treatment recommendation.

4️⃣ ReAct Agents (Reasoning and Acting)
📌 The multitaskers who act and think (we love an efficient king).
What they do: Integrate reasoning with real-time decision-making. Perfect for dynamic, on-the-fly problem-solving.
Use Cases:
- Interactive chatbots.
- Managing supply chain issues.
Example: Noticing inventory shortages, reordering products, and adjusting based on real-time data—all in one go.

5️⃣ Planning Agents
📌 The strategic masterminds (think AI meets chess grandmaster).
What they do: Create action plans to optimize long-term goals, adapting to changes as they go.
Use Cases:
- Business workflow.
- Business strategy.
Example: Planning the safest, most efficient driving route for an autonomous vehicle.

Now that we’ve cut through the high-level fluff, here’s the kicker: building these agents is hard. But it doesn’t have to be—for you, at least.
With Writer, you don’t need to worry about backend complexity. We’re the only platform that offers a full-stack generative AI solution, so you can focus on building impactful agents without sweating the tech.",2025-01-11 21:29:07.829999924,522,39,51,2025-01,im sure everyone shouting rooftop year ai agent let realmost whats said vague highlevel fluff sound impressive tell nothing useful let cut noise talk actual level detail llm agentsbecause agent created equal theyre magical ai fairy solve everything here breakdown llm agent type without buzzword salad basic llm agent need nodrama straightforward solution take simple input spit coherent response thats use case writing email blog answering simple question example ask draft blog ai healthcare boomyouve got passable first draft easy peasy cot agent chain thought overthinkers ai world break complex task logical stepbystep reasoning great need behind answer use case analyzing legal doc solving multistep math problem example reviewing legal contract clause clause telling probably shouldnt sign rag agent retrievalaugmented generation sometimes even ai need google thing fetch relevant information external source combine generative capability use case personalized customer support knowledge management example pulling medical research rare disease generating detailed treatment recommendation react agent reasoning acting multitaskers act think love efficient king integrate reasoning realtime decisionmaking perfect dynamic onthefly problemsolving use case interactive chatbots managing supply chain issue example noticing inventory shortage reordering product adjusting based realtime dataall one go planning agent strategic mastermind think ai meet chess grandmaster create action plan optimize longterm goal adapting change go use case business workflow business strategy example planning safest efficient driving route autonomous vehicle weve cut highlevel fluff here kicker building agent hard doesnt befor least writer dont need worry backend complexity platform offer fullstack generative ai solution focus building impactful agent without sweating tech,0.15990028490028493,positive,0

getwriter,"How can brands build emotional connections at scale with customers? And what role can AI play in this process?

May sat down with Michelle Taite, CMO of Intuit Mailchimp, to discuss the future of brand loyalty and marketing at the Brand Innovators Leadership Summit at #CES2025.

Key takeaways from their conversation:

🔹 Trust is King: In an era of information overload, trust is crucial for brand loyalty. Over 70% of consumers expect personalized experiences, and 47% make purchase decisions based on brand trust. Trust is built over time but can be lost quickly. Michelle emphasized that while brands aim to create a seamless customer journey, consumers often value promotions and discounts, which can also build trust.

🔹 Sincere Personalization: Personalization is no longer a luxury but a necessity. Consumers expect brands to use their data to deliver high-value, relevant experiences. Michelle shared an example from Airbnb, where a search for a beach vacation led to personalized results featuring pianos with a view, which created a deeper connection based on her unique interests. This level of personalization requires sophisticated data instrumentation and activation.

🔹 Shared Courage: Courageous acts by brands can be contagious. When a brand takes bold, innovative actions, it can inspire customers to be more courageous in their interactions with the brand. This shared courage helps build a strong, loyal community. Michelle highlighted that brands that take risks and innovate are more likely to resonate with their audience and foster long-term loyalty.

🔹 The Future of Email: Despite the rise of AI and other communication channels, email remains a powerful tool for building emotional connections. Michelle reminded us that email is the highest ROI channel for marketers. Mailchimp uses predictive analytics and generative AI to create highly targeted and visually appealing emails, ensuring that marketers can keep up with the vast amounts of data available.

getwriter,"Second panel at #CES2025 ✅

What a thrill to join so many fantastic leaders to discuss Beyond's AI Marketing Hype Cycle.

My top takeaways:

🔹 AI’s Impact on Marketing: The panel talked about how in the past year, marketers (like many functions) have evolved their thinking “from the wow to the how of AI”. While there has been progress — our customers are living proof — there's still a way to go to integrate AI across the entire marketing operation for the greatest impact.

🔹 ​​The Role of AI in Improving Efficiency and Productivity: Some great panelist quotes on this topic: ""If you look at who are gonna be all winners in AI, it's those who are gonna be able to figure out how to tie planning and measurement and activation together with the same common layer""...""We have to find the mission-critical use case that others are starting to see success from and think about how you're gonna rebuild that use case from the ground up to be AI first.""

🔹 Maintaining Trust in a Data-Driven World: While AI can provide valuable insights, these insights must align with a deep understanding of the consumer, maintaining their trust and ensuring their data is handled responsibly. “The key is not more data…rather, it is how are we using AI to translate and activate on the data.”

A special shout-out to session sponsor MediaLink and my fellow panelists: Cognitiv’s Aaron Andalman, Basis Technologies’ Tyler Kelley, Amgen’s Erin (Monaco) Nocito, The Weather Company’s Randi Stipes, MediaLink’s Mark Wagman, and our moderator David Cohen from IAB.

getwriter,"For a long time, the common belief in AI has been “bigger is better”—more parameters, more power. But the truth is, we’re hitting a point where just stacking on more “size” isn’t the game-changer we hoped. Our roughly 140B-parameter model can already outperform some massive trillion-parameter systems from tech giants like Google or GPT-4’s variants.

How is that possible? The key isn’t brute force. It’s about being smarter with what we have—optimizing the way we distribute computing power and using more sophisticated reasoning strategies. Think of it like a small, well-trained team that outperforms a huge army because they coordinate better and use their knowledge more effectively.

What’s next? By 2025, I believe we’ll see a new wave of lean, nimble AI models that can actually “teach” themselves over time. These will be “self-evolving” and more adaptable—less about sheer size, and more about becoming truly self-improving.

We’re entering an era where AI won’t just be bigger. It will be more intelligent, more dynamic, and more resourceful, paving the way for transformative breakthroughs across every industry. It’s time to think beyond raw scale and get ready for smarter, leaner, self-evolving AI.",2024-12-19 03:05:05.500999928,199,15,8,2024-12,long time common belief ai bigger bettermore parameter power truth hitting point stacking size isnt gamechanger hoped roughly bparameter model already outperform massive trillionparameter system tech giant like google gpts variant possible key isnt brute force smarter haveoptimizing way distribute computing power using sophisticated reasoning strategy think like small welltrained team outperforms huge army coordinate better use knowledge effectively whats next believe well see new wave lean nimble ai model actually teach time selfevolving adaptableless sheer size becoming truly selfimproving entering era ai wont bigger intelligent dynamic resourceful paving way transformative breakthrough across every industry time think beyond raw scale get ready smarter leaner selfevolving ai,0.2501695274422547,positive,4

We’re still buzzing from our 4th AI Leaders Forum — and SO thankful to everyone who joined us for this world-class gathering of executives, experts, and thought leaders 👏. The conversations featured real stories, from real customers, who are delivering real ROI — punctuated by a special fireside chat with a legend in the media and business world, and a discussion on recent advancements to the Writer platform.

Highlights:
🔹 Writer CEO and co-founder May Habib welcomed the group to kick off the day, which transitioned to a customer panel on how to scale generative AI from proof-of-concept to full-scale production. The range of perspectives on stage — from consulting leader Accenture, to home building giant Lennar, to global investment management firm Franklin Templeton — were invaluable in both their different use cases, but at the same time their shared principles which have led to success in their AI journeys.

🔹 WndrCo Founding Partner and media icon Jeffrey Katzenberg joined May on stage for a simply memorable fireside chat. Jeffrey embodies the power of storytelling, and his wisdom resonated with everyone in the room on a profound level, both professionally and personally.

🔹 AI in Action: Writer customers are indeed the “bull case” for generative AI in the enterprise, and we’re so fortunate that leaders from Uber, CirrusMD, Salesforce, and Adore Me each took the stage to dive deep on their generative AI deployments, insights, and best practices. From their top use cases, to change management tactics, to ROI metrics and more, these companies are proof that transformation with generative AI is real and just getting started.

🔹 The product showcase was an eye-opener, as Writer’s product leaders shared the latest improvements and announcements related to the platform, including a deep-dive Q&A session.

🔹 Moderator Ron Miller wrapped the day with a fireside chat with co-founders May and Waseem Alshikh, as they looked to the future of enterprise AI, explored Writer’s journey, and discussed how generative AI is set to become the backbone of mission-critical enterprise workflows.

The attendees gathered for an evening event to raise a toast to each other and the growing community at AI Leaders Forum. Stay tuned for announcements on our next AILF, which will be held in London! 🇬🇧

In addition to a bunch of beautiful cosmetic updates, under the hood improvements, and bug fixes, the big news here is TOOL CALLING!

The way we've implemented tool calling in Writer Framework is incredible, abstracting away tedious implementation and recursively running your functions for you. No need to check for the ""tool"" role and run your own functions! You can even specify a maximum depth of recursion. 

I'm so excited about it that I had to make you a quick simple demo just to show you how mind-boggling this is (don't worry, flashier demos coming soon). I'm honestly not aware of any other Python framework that makes tool calling this easy.

To get started, just run `pip install writer==0.8.2`.

getwriter,"#GenerativeAI in healthcare has unique opportunities and challenges. 

The right applications can dramatically improve human health while cutting the administrative burdens that are strangling healthcare and life sciences, but the consequences of an unaddressed hallucination can be disastrous.

For the forseeable future - only humans can provide true judgment and accountability, and #HITL is an essential part of any meaningful GenAI solution in Healthcare and Life Sciences.  But the devil is in the details - poorly engineered HITL can easily lead to either
- under-supervised AI solutions (which are dangerous), or 
- clunky systems where it's easier for the user to create from scratch than it is to confirm the output of an AI-based system

Workflow and process engineering are proving to be at least as important as the technical build in delivering AI solutions that are both impactful and responsible.  The key design principles are:

1. Human Review and Confirmation: Require human users to review and attest to the veracity of materials where AI is involved in generation.  The UI/UX should add some strategic friction that slows the temption to ""click-through"" without thinking

2. Transparency and Explainability: Ensure the AI system explains its reasoning and makes it easy for users to reference back to the original source of truth documents – whether that's scientific literature or specific data points.  This UX needs to be as friction-less as possible.

3. Continuous Monitoring: Implement ongoing surveillance and monitoring of the whole system, including both the human and AI components

4. User Training: Provide adequate training on using and interpreting AI outputs, and the difference between nondeterministic GenAI and more traditional deterministic technologies. Emphasize the importance of critical thinking and human judgment.

The exact details may differ, but at Writer we've found these principles to be equally relevant for #ClinicalDecisionSupport, #UtilizationManagement, #MLR review, or any other critical Healthcare and Life Sciences applications.",2024-12-02 15:23:16.569999933,28,0,2,2024-12,generativeai healthcare unique opportunity challenge right application dramatically improve human health cutting administrative burden strangling healthcare life science consequence unaddressed hallucination disastrous forseeable future human provide true judgment accountability hitl essential part meaningful genai solution healthcare life science devil detail poorly engineered hitl easily lead either undersupervised ai solution dangerous clunky system easier user create scratch confirm output aibased system workflow process engineering proving least important technical build delivering ai solution impactful responsible key design principle human review confirmation require human user review attest veracity material ai involved generation uiux add strategic friction slows temption clickthrough without thinking transparency explainability ensure ai system explains reasoning make easy user reference back original source truth document whether thats scientific literature specific data point ux need frictionless possible continuous monitoring implement ongoing surveillance monitoring whole system including human ai component user training provide adequate training using interpreting ai output difference nondeterministic genai traditional deterministic technology emphasize importance critical thinking human judgment exact detail may differ writer weve found principle equally relevant clinicaldecisionsupport utilizationmanagement mlr review critical healthcare life science application,0.06418650793650793,neutral,2

getwriter,"📖 What we're reading: This BBC article is an important story on how the “avalanche” of new AI tools in the workplace can hurt employee productivity and satisfaction. This piece was called out in last Friday's fireside chat with May and Diego and underscores the importance of key principles every organization should consider before starting their AI journey.

Here's what we've learned in working with hundreds of customers on how to not just avoid burnout at work, but increase employee satisfaction and engagement:

✅ Do no harm. Don't force employees to use a tool or platform that doesn't make them more productive. Companies taking that approach need to do more upfront work, meaning:
✅ Focus on mission-critical workflows. Identify which use cases will deliver the most business impact, and work backwards from there — rather than giving vague guidance to ""use AI"" with little follow-up or support.
✅ Deliver the goods. Select technology and service providers that WILL deliver on your goals, and demand that expectation from the start.

The AI conversation no longer starts with automating the most mundane tasks. It starts with identifying and transforming your most important workflows.

getwriter,"Excited to share an important research breakthrough we’ve achieved at Writer — self-evolving models. As we look to the future of scalable AI we need new techniques that allow LLMs to reflect, evaluate, and remember. Self-evolving models can learn new information in real-time , updating a memory pool integrated at each layer of the transfromer. 

The implications of this technology are profound. While it can dramatically improve model accuracy, relevancy, and training cost — it introduces new risks, like the model’s ability to un-censor itself — that must be well understood and effectively mitigated. Self-evolving models are still in early testing at Writer, but here are three links to help you understand our approach to this technology and what it can mean for LLMs

getwriter,"With all the buzz about #Transformers hitting their limits, let's be real - they're still the powerhouse of modern #AI. Why? Because their ability to connect and understand information is unmatched. 

Here's a simple breakdown of the AI architectures race:

#RNN (Recurrent Neural Networks)
Imagine taking meeting notes where you can only write one word at a time, and you can't look back at your previous notes. Pretty limiting, right? That's RNN - they process information one piece at a time, making it hard to capture the big picture.

Transformers (Like #GPT-4 & #Palmyra)
Now imagine being in a meeting where you can see and hear everyone at once, noticing who's paying attention to whom (that's the famous ""attention mechanism""!). You can catch Bob nodding at Alice's idea, while Carol's building on Dave's point. This ability to ""pay attention"" to everything at once is what made Transformers revolutionary and why they're still leading the AI race!

State Space Models (Like #Mamba)
Think of having an AI assistant that can scan an entire meeting transcript in one go, but instead of trying to process every single interaction (like Transformers do), it knows exactly which parts need focus. It's like having a super-efficient executive who knows precisely where to look without getting overwhelmed by all the details.

 Why Transformers Won (For Now):
- They can see the whole picture at once (unlike RNNs)
- Their ""attention mechanism"" is like having perfect meeting awareness
- They can understand context better by connecting different parts of information
- They're like having dozens of assistants working in parallel!

At Writer, we're big believers in the attention mechanism's power - it's why our models use Transformer architecture. But we're not standing still. We're constantly exploring ways to make attention deeper and more efficient, pushing the boundaries of what's possible. 

Think of it like upgrading from a room full of attentive listeners to a stadium of AI experts who can not only pay attention but also learn and adapt their focus in increasingly complex ways.",2024-11-17 23:58:22.283999920,163,4,6,2024-11,buzz transformer hitting limit let real theyre still powerhouse modern ai ability connect understand information unmatched here simple breakdown ai architecture race rnn recurrent neural network imagine taking meeting note write one word time cant look back previous note pretty limiting right thats rnn process information one piece time making hard capture big picture transformer like gpt palmyra imagine meeting see hear everyone noticing who paying attention thats famous attention mechanism catch bob nodding alices idea carol building daves point ability pay attention everything made transformer revolutionary theyre still leading ai race state space model like mamba think ai assistant scan entire meeting transcript one go instead trying process every single interaction like transformer know exactly part need focus like superefficient executive know precisely look without getting overwhelmed detail transformer see whole picture unlike rnns attention mechanism like perfect meeting awareness understand context better connecting different part information theyre like dozen assistant working parallel writer big believer attention mechanism power model use transformer architecture standing still constantly exploring way make attention deeper efficient pushing boundary whats possible think like upgrading room full attentive listener stadium ai expert pay attention also learn adapt focus increasingly complex way,0.16025722789115648,positive,0

activecampaign,"My newsletter reached 100,000 subscribers a few weeks ago. Here’s what I’ve learned:

1️⃣ Start with what you can manage, then scale. It’s easier to move from monthly to biweekly than the reverse. The newsletters I love the most (I’m looking at you, Wes Kao) stick to a consistent schedule, and that keeps me coming back.

2️⃣ The best content comes from real conversations. Some of my favorite newsletters began as answers to questions or chats with my friends. Writing isn’t just about broadcasting your thoughts. It’s about listening.

3️⃣ Simplicity wins every time. I tend to ✨ yap ✨ when I’m writing, so this one has been huge. Respect your readers’ time.

4️⃣ Starting my newsletter on LinkedIn gave me the space to grow. But as I look ahead to 2025, I want deeper insights into how people engage so I can create an even better experience.

That’s where tools like ActiveCampaign come in. It was the first email marketing platform I used when I started in marketing, and it’s only gotten more powerful over the years. Their features (like segmentation, predictive content, and AI-powered automation) make it easier to understand your audience and send smarter campaigns. 

Plus, their AI brand kit lets you create beautiful, on-brand emails like *that*. ✨

activecampaign,"Managing Channel Sales in Your CRM

I had a meeting two days with a local SME that provides IT services and products. They are a B2B business evaluating ActiveCampaign for their CRM, and one of the biggest discussion points was channel sales management as a large part of their business is driven through a few key channel partners.

This process can vary widely between organizations, and let’s be honest—it’s hard to find a CRM that nails it perfectly since most are built around a direct sales team/process. No magic bullet but I always feel flexibility is critical when handling channel sales in the CRM, as needs can differ significantly between companies and even different teams within the same company.

If you’re in the same boat, here are some strategies we explored to help ActiveCampaign work as a central hub for managing channel sales:

🎯 Dedicated Pipelines for Key Channel Partners
One approach we discussed was setting up individual pipelines for each major channel partner. With separate pipelines, channel managers get a clear view of activities and performance by that key partner, making tracking, reporting, and prioritization straightforward. By tailoring each partner’s deal stages specific to the process of working with them, it’s much easier to ensure leads move efficiently from contact to close.

🏷️ Track Leads with Event-Based Tags
For this SME, channel leads often come through events, so we explored using ActiveCampaign’s forms and landing pages to capture leads at each event and tag them accordingly. For instance, if a partner holds a trade show, any lead captured could be tagged to that event, so managers know exactly where each lead came from. This tagging structure is perfect for targeted follow-ups and engagement based on each lead’s journey.

🛠️ Customize Tracking with Custom Fields
To gather more in-depth data, custom fields in ActiveCampaign’s Deals pipeline are incredibly useful. Think about adding fields like “Last Event Attended” or “Product Interest,” which help channel managers better understand each lead’s needs. This level of detail makes it easier to send personalized outreach and spot trends in product interest or event impact over time.

📈 Additional Recommendations:
Set Up Automated Follow-Ups: Automation in ActiveCampaign can trigger follow-ups based on tags or custom fields, helping channel managers stay on top of every lead.

Real-Time Notifications for Channel Leads: Get notified when a lead advances, so your team can respond quickly and keep the momentum going.

Wrapping Up: Managing channel sales in your CRM is no one-size-fits-all approach and it's important to have a flexible mindset and expect some workarounds to achieve your key objectives.

activecampaign,"If you work in Marketing, you’re gonna want to read this post. 😎

Trust me.  

And if you’re as into AI as I am, you’ll be thanking me by the end. 🤓

Last week, I made a discovery that left me speechless, seriously. It’s been so wild that I’ve been trying to write this post for days but couldn’t quite figure out how to put it into words. 🙃

Let’s break it down. 

I was working on a Google Sheets dashboard for a creator we’re supporting at Level Up Creators—tons of data from all over the place. Basically, a dashboard that pulls together all their business data into one sheet. 

Pretty big deal, right? 😉

Well, I hit a bunch of roadblocks with the connectors for the different sources because the data just wasn’t coming through how I needed. I was stuck with what’s available today. 😡

And, not being a coder, I couldn’t just whip up what I needed myself. 

But then... I had a lightbulb moment.

💡 What if I could use ChatGPT to help me create all the code I needed for a custom script tailored to my needs?

I had already done something similar in the past when I built a GPT that connected to my ActiveCampaign account and acted as a real-time assistant for analyzing all my metrics. Super cool. But this time... I took it up a notch.

So... I used ChatGPT to create a Google Apps Script that builds a custom database in Google Sheets with all the data from our client's ActiveCampaign account—campaigns, automations, tags, and way more. 💣💣💣

Basically, for $0, I built an alternative to some well-known connectors like the one that starts with ""Super"" and ends with ""Metrics"" 😬 (which can cost hundreds of dollars a month).

And this doesn’t just work for ActiveCampaign 👉 you can do it for other platforms too, using their APIs and docs (which, btw, you don’t even need to read—ChatGPT’s got you covered).

I seriously recommend trying out this ChatGPT + Google Apps Script combo. You might surprise yourself with how easy it is to do things that seem impossible.

If you need tips or want to know more about how I did it, drop a comment below, and I’ll share what worked for me!

BTW, I asked ChatGPT, and it suggested I share it here with you on LinkedIn, so make sure to thank it, not me! 🤣

Using Bluecore, retailers will soon be able to make their own ecommerce sites, email campaigns, SMS and mobile apps conversational by anticipating and answering shoppers’ questions about their products. 🤩 The new integrated capabilities will be available for Bluecore customers in Q1 2025, giving retailers even more powerful capabilities to move more customers through the lifecycle.

As part of the acquisition, alby’s CEO Max Bennett – who is also one of Bluecore’s original co-founders and author of “A Brief History of Intelligence” – will join the company to lead alby’s evolution.

“Unlike the technology of the past, these conversational AI systems will look very different depending on whether you are buying a fashion, consumer goods or sporting goods product. Paired with Bluecore, we can make these experiences even more magical, and create a truly intelligent retail platform that becomes smarter on its own, over time, as it learns about shoppers.” – Max Bennett

Good retail marketing works the same way.

Valentine’s Day is no longer just for couples. Today, people also use the holiday to celebrate their kids, their friends, and even themselves.

The holiday also represents the first big shopping event of the year, which makes it the perfect opportunity for retailers to nurture *their* most important relationships: Those with their customers.

We’ve broken down five ways retailers can do that at every stage of the lifecycle:

Bluecore CMO Jason Grunberg notes that while marketers know generative AI will help them solve problems... many haven't nailed down what those problems *are* just yet.

""When marketers can identify where their customers’ problems intersect with company challenges — and solve for them both with AI — they’ll drive business growth in the process. For example, Amazon introduced its AI shopping assistant Rufus to make it easier for shoppers to find products and quickly get their questions answered, but the technology also increases conversion and revenue,"" he shares with Forbes.

bluecore,"🎶 He’s making a list 🎶 And checking it twice 🎶
🎶 With shopper ID, he knows who’s on site 🎶

Identification is the engine that powers customer movement. Only when you know who a shopper is, you can engage them with tailored, signal-based messaging that moves them through the lifecycle. Identification is extra important during the holidays, when most retailers see an influx of new shoppers.

Our team recently stayed up (way too) late analyzing data from billions of Black Friday orders, sales, and shopper events in order to understand industry trends. One of our favorite takeaways?

📈 ID rates are on the rise.

On Black Friday, the average retailer was able to identify 29% of their site visitors, up from 21% last year. Every vertical improved there — none more than apparel, which increased their ID rates by 7% on average.

We analyzed billions of orders, sales, and shopper events in order to understand industry trends and how top retailers moved their customers through the lifecycle. The result? Our annual Black Friday Benchmarks Report.

With acquisition costs through the roof, many retailers focused their efforts on engaging their active customer bases. The numbers reflected that:

📉 Year-over-year, site traffic decreased by 6.2% while order volume dipped by 2.7%

But at the same time…

💪 36.5% of sales were attributed to repeat buyers, which is significant given how many new buyers brands tend to see during the holidays. Enterprise retailers were particularly strong with retention, with 51% of their customers being repeat buyers.

To engage customers with tailored, signal-based messaging, brands must first know who they are. This year, the average identification rate was 29%, a jump from last year’s 21%.

That backwards-looking data is where legacy systems shine. But without predictive data, retailers are left in the dark.

Retailers need to connect the dots across all customer interactions.

Channel and purchase data can only help achieve that when they’re combined with streaming shopper identification, event data (behavior and product catalog), and prospect data.

Legacy systems don’t allow retailers to anticipate and respond to customer needs. They also have plenty of hidden costs: wasted time and resources, and missed revenue opportunities.

bluecore,"Most apparel retailers focus their marketing efforts:
💎 Courting their most active VIP customers… who will probably buy anyway
👻 Converting their non-buyers…. who may not

There’s another segment of customers who represent your biggest ROI and incremental revenue opportunity. We call them the movable middle. Often overlooked, those in “the movable middle” have purchased at least once. They’re not loyal customers… but with the right signal-based messages, they can be.

Ranking your customers by their predicted lifetime value will give you a good sense of who’s in your movable middle. Behavioral signals that indicate a willingness to engage — browsing, adding items to (or even abandoning) carts — are also good indicators.

Say a first-time buyer recently got a pair of jeans. They haven’t made a second purchase, but they have browsed jackets and tops, and abandoned a cart with two sweaters.

🎯 This customer is probably part of the movable middle.

Once you’ve identified that, the next step is to align shopping signals and timely, relevant messaging. These customers can be reached with less effort  — and more payback — than brand new ones.

They want control, but expect ease. Personalized experiences resonate with them, but they’re concerned with privacy. They like the simplicity of digital channels, but still crave human interactions.

bluecore,"The customer journey is no longer linear. Shoppers fluidly move between devices, channels, and moments of engagement.

So why don’t most retailers approach communications that way? 🤔

The answer lies in signals. Whether they’re browsing, clicking, or adding an item to their cart, every action a shopper takes a signal you can react to. However, relying on behavioral signals, which are just the tip of the iceberg, limits your marketing options.

The average retailer misses 80-90% of the signals available to them. 🤯

Beyond behaviors, there are also identification, product, lifecycle, and transactional signals. Understanding them is the key to mapping out your biggest opportunities to engage every shopper and move them through the lifecycle with relevant messaging. 

Signals may look the same but they mean something different based on customer preferences and where they are in the lifecycle. You wouldn’t send the same product recommendation to a frequent buyer who purchases mostly basics as you would to a frequent buyer who stays on-trend.

bluecore,"Retailers tend to increase their email send volume during the holidays. Bluecore customers sent about 40% more emails during November and December relative to the rest of the year.

That uptick in messaging can make you more likely to connect with your customers… but it can also lead to deliverability issues.

Deliverability is the unsung hero of email marketing. The best campaigns and the most beautiful creative won’t make a difference if your messages land in the digital abyss that is the spam folder. (On average, 10.5% of them do, with another 6.4% going missing and undelivered, according to Email Tooltester S.L.

With the holidays fast approaching, Bluecore Director of Deliverability Nandini Rathi shares four best practices to make sure your messages reach their intended recipients:

📩 Conduct an email marketing program audit: Review your authentication and ensure your records are in place for SPF, DKIM, and DMARC.

📩 Increase send volume gradually: Avoid daily volume spikes greater than 30%. A sudden spike in volume is a major red flag for ISPs, which can hurt deliverability.

📩 Keep your email lists clean: Determine whether the email addresses on your inactive lists are valid before you message them. That will limit hard bounces, which factor into your sender reputation score.

📩 Reactive and re-engage: Identify shoppers who have received, but not engaged with, your emails in the last six months. This is a great start for re-engaging lapsed buyers with deliverability in mind.

To convert those customers in November, retailers must get their strategies in place *now*. During our most recent Coffee & Commerce, we discussed three that are particularly impactful:

1️⃣ Optimizing your site for identification 
Last year, 79% (aka, way too many) of Black Friday shoppers were unidentified. When you know who your shoppers are, you can reach them later and move them through the lifecycle.

2️⃣ Paying attention to shopping signals
In just a few minutes of clicking around, shoppers give retailers a wealth of information about their preferences, price and category affinities, and more. With signals, you can send tailored messaging based on actions, such as abandoning checkout, which shows that a shopper is thinking about making a purchase.

3️⃣ Maximizing the value of your existing customer base
Last Black Friday, 62% of enterprise retailers’ sales came from repeat buyers. Identifying your existing customers, and using what you know about them to engage proactively, can build loyalty leading up to Black Friday.

bluecore,"Nearly three-quarters of a retailer’s customers are one-and-done, which drags down average purchase frequency within a new customer’s first year.

Looking at purchase data from 100+ retailers spanning the entire last year, we found that only 16.5% of first-time buyers made a second purchase. That leaves a lot of room for improvement across every retail vertical. 

Repeat purchase rates vary wildly. Brands may see major differences based on differences like price point or how often people need to replace consumable products. 

Health and Beauty retailers had the highest repeat purchase rates (21.5%), with Sporting Goods and Outdoor brands just behind them. Both are categories that tend to sell a range of lower cost items that people purchase often.

Jewelry and Luxury had a 9.9% repeat purchase rate, possibly due to the high price point and durable nature of many luxury goods.

bluecore,"You have your VIP customers, the loyalists who love your brand and buy regularly. You also have your one-and-dones, those customers who made their first purchase and promptly disappeared. 

Somewhere in between is a hidden opportunity: the movable middle.

The key to incremental growth, the movable middle can generally be reactivated with far less effort (and greater ROI) than a brand new customer.

L'Oréal, the world’s most valuable beauty brand, has been saying that to customers for more than 50 years. It’s an important sentiment because their products — and all other health and beauty brands’ products — have potential to become part of the customers’ personal brands, improving confidence, self-care, and empowerment.

Personalization is “worth it” for these brands. But just as the customer journey has evolved, personalized experiences must evolve along with it.

To drive repeat purchases and retention, health and beauty brands must create cross-category buyers. As early as they can.

bluecore,"When retailers started talking about “the customer journey,” it was a different world. A decade ago, there were far fewer channels, which meant the brand was in control of the journey.

Today, the customer is in the driver’s seat. And the savviest retailers are changing their approach to the customer journey accordingly: more nimble, more real-time, more responsive. 

By realigning around the customers, retailers can drive both short-term revenue *and* sustainable growth.

“Rather than feel the heat every time there’s a downturn, retailers with a customer-led strategy have a stable base of active and profitable customers that act like an engine to deliver a foundation of revenue and inform acquisition so that it gets better and more effective over time,” explains our CEO Fayez Mohamood.

bluecore,"While 74% of the average retailer’s customers are one-time buyers, marketers have untapped opportunities within one-time purchasers and inactive segments. 🔑

Bluecore data found that reactivated buyers are much more valuable than a new customer. Reactivated customers spend 12.7% more, with a 7.7% increase in purchase frequency. Plus, reactivating those buyers helps CAC payback and will make your customer base more active, and ultimately more profitable. 

That's why the savviest marketing leaders like Jennifer Slegers (Sopko) work to understand inactive buyers and come up with strategies specifically designed to move certain customer segments. For instance, Jenn told Total Retail in a recent interview, ""all first time to second time buyers aren't the same."" 

To actually reactivate buyers, Carhartt has set up different strategies for the 12-month inactive buyer, as well as for buyers who are inactive longer than 12 months -- segments which other retailers may refer to as ""lost or dead.""

bluecore,"You know that loyal customers are your best customers, but how will you know that a newly acquired customer will become loyal? And how do you know how loyal a customer is if they aren’t a loyalty member?

The answer comes by tracking “customer survivorship.”

Customer survivorship is the length of time a retailer keeps a new customer active after their first purchase.

🔹 Only 6% of new customers survive as active customers for three years or more on average
🔹 Sporting Goods & Outdoor and Apparel have the highest three year survivorship at nearly 10%
🔹 The biggest drop-off in the percent of active new customers is between year 1 and 2, when nearly 80% of new customers don’t buy again.

Any improvement in survivorship delivers major value to retailers. The customers with the potential to become repeat purchasers deserve extra marketing attention.

🏆 Across Bluecore’s customer base, 35% of sales come from the top quartile of customers.

Analyzing how long new customers stay active provides an indication of how loyal they are and how much potential lifetime value they have. And understanding their behavior provides clues for how to drive higher loyalty through retention marketing to new customers.

Recognizing the signals that indicate potential for repeat purchase and retention, and using those signals to create more relevant marketing experiences is the secret to increasing your loyal customer base.

bluecore,"Our data shows that 74% of a retailer’s customers are one-and-done, which drags down average purchase frequency within a new customer’s first year. The percent of first time buyers who made a second purchase was only 16.5%, leaving a lot of room for improvement across retail sectors. 

Repeat purchase rate varies widely. Different retail categories see major differences in repeat purchase based on differences like price point, how often people need to replace consumable products. 

💄 Health & Beauty retailers had the highest repeat purchase rates at 21.5%. These brands tends to sell a range of lower-cost items that people purchase often.

💍 Jewelry and Luxury had the lowest repeat purchase rate, possibly due to the high price point and durable nature of many luxury goods.

Understanding how you compare to your category is a good place to start. For any brand, regardless of category, focusing on strategies that improve repeat purchase rates will have a positive impact on revenue.

bluecore,"Once you acquire a shopper, you can set the stage for what will (hopefully) be a long, fruitful relationship. But first, you have to convert them.

Conversion is easier said than done given fierce competition, cagey social platforms, and budget-conscious shopping. During our most recent Coffee & Commerce event, we shared four ways you can overcome these challenges and turn non-buyers into customers.

☕ Pay attention to customer signals: From visiting a page to carting an item, everything a shopper does represents a signal you can react to with relevant messaging. They’re especially powerful when combined with product signals, such as whether an item is new or low inventory.

☕ Implement frequent testing: If you’re not sure what will get a shopper past the final hurdle of the checkout page, you can also use those customer signals to A/B test your way into a substantial conversion lift. We’ve found that free shipping is far more enticing toward the *end* of the purchase funnel than the beginning.

☕ Boost first purchase value through recommendations: Think of magazines and chocolate bars by the register. Most people aren’t going to the grocery store specifically for those items… but while they’re there, they may as well, right? You can mimic that by enhancing search result pages with relevant product recommendations.

☕ Optimizing social marketing: Social media marketing has grown far more expensive while walled gardens have made the platforms harder to scale. One workaround is to separate buyers from non-buyers before you input your audiences, and discount accordingly.

While that old poem wasn’t written about retail… it could have been.

Last week, we released our first-of-its-kind Customer Growth Benchmarks Report. Rather than focus on channel metrics such as opens and clicks, we zeroed in on the customer-centric metrics most aligned with a brand's business health.

bluecore,"🚨🔬New Bluecore data finds that retailers with the highest shopper identification rates see 53% more repeat purchases vs. brands with lower identification rates. 🔬🚨

For most retailers, this year’s profits will come from the customers they already know. So this new data is a significant indicator for how marketers can simultaneously build short-term revenue lift and long-term profitability. 

This is one of many new findings from the industry’s first-of-its-kind Customer Growth Benchmarks report. 

Instead of capturing the data that is easy to collect (i.e. channel metrics such as open rates, click rates), Bluecore’s annual benchmarks report focuses on the *critical benchmarks that are most aligned with business health.* 🤯 

Our report dives into key customer-centric metrics for retailers across the lifecycle, and across retail categories. Each category is benchmarked separately so that retail leaders are able to compare their own performance with a relevant peer set. 

While every brand has unique trends, Bluecore finds that retailers focused on the metrics and best practices that drive customer movement have higher performance across the customer lifecycle.

bluecore,"Reach drives retail growth. But between cookie depreciation and rising acquisition costs, it’s never been more at risk.

Many retailers may default to “more” — more emails, more texts, more discounts — which can help hit quarterly goals. But they need a sustainable growth framework that *also* drives long-term, profitable growth.

That framework is customer movement.

Customer movement is the practice of understanding customer value and using signal-based strategies to “move” shoppers from:
🔹  Unknown to known
🔹  Non-buyers to new buyers
🔹  One-time buyers to repeat and eventually, loyal customers
🔹  Lapsed to reactivated buyers

Customer movement increases reach, relevance, and purchase frequency. No wonder retail leaders who embrace it see an average three-year customer retention rate of 59%.

bluecore,"“How can we acquire customers without draining our budgets?” That’s the million dollar question on every retailer’s mind.

Many retailers look to their marketing channels for the answer. But while sending more emails and texts may deliver quick wins, prioritizing the *customer* and moving them through the lifecycle increases reach, relevance, purchase frequency, and revenue in the long run.

Acquisition is ultimately what sets customer movement in motion. To help you improve yours, we’ve outlined the three highest-impact areas of focus:

🔎 Increasing identification rates: You can’t move a customer through the lifecycle without first knowing who they are and how to communicate with them.

👯‍♂️ Optimizing paid media spend: Suppress your most active customers, who you’ve already acquired, and instead build lookalike models of them.

👋 Increasing site engagement: Whether it’s an email capture or dynamic product recommendations, your site offers countless ways to nudge shoppers toward that first purchase.

Most abandoned cart or abandoned browse campaigns are basic and templatized. While there’s nothing wrong with “Your throw pillows are waiting for you,” this messaging is so commonplace that it doesn’t stand out.

In her latest Total Retail byline, Sara Lapworth, a senior digital marketing and retail strategy consultant at Bluecore, shares how retailers can refresh stale triggered campaigns.

The key? Considering the signals.

From browsing to adding items to their cart, every action a shopper takes represents a signal. When retailers combine those shopper signals with product signals, such as size or price point, and lifecycle signals, like whether they’re a new buyer or a loyalty member, they have a wealth of personalization opportunities.

pixisai,"Hello Everyone,

I would like to share with you, A Media First usage in Turkey utilizing Artificial Intelligence with OMD & Nissan Automotive & Pixis. 

As the Nissan OMD Turkey team, we are thrilled to share our Media First AI campaign optimization usage that we have executed with the company Pixis, in Turkey. 
Artificial Intelligence continues to improve itself every day, and here at OMD we are always looking for new opportunities to expand our reach and adapt to new technologies. 

Pixis develops codeless AI infrastructure to help brands scale all aspects of their marketing in a world of complex consumer behavior. We have decided to use Pixis AI in our Meta Lead Ad campaigns, where we aim to increase the brand's automotive sales figures.
We started our pilot period in March 2024 with Pixis, where we separated our campaigns to measure the uplift that AI can create for us. Our main KPI for this collaboration was to decrease the cost per unit and increase the lead delivery on our campaigns.
We have created a campaign specifically for Pixis on META, where all our campaign optimizations belonged to the AI. We drew comparisons between our pilot campaign and our own campaign with manual optimizations, which we developed over a long period, completed our learning, and included AI targeting. 

-       In the first month of our pilot period with Pixis, AI-operated campaigns have shown a 24% down-lift in cost per unit.
(But please keep in mind that our campaigns had been developed for almost half a year).
-       Starting in the second month of our pilot period, AI has shown a 2% uplift in April.
-        period being May 2024, AI has shown a 20% uplift!
Looking at our summary conclusions, we can easily say that AI only needed one month to complete its learnings and develop itself to exceed our campaign which took a long time to develop 😊
This study showed us that, Artificial Intelligence continues to improve in a frightening but efficient way.
AI-optimized campaigns help us fill an important gap in the Digital Media Buying industry, as they offer 24-hour optimized campaigns with efficient results and greatly reduced man-hours. After our study, we have seen that AI is getting more and more prominent in our sector with promising results.
We wanted to share our AI-optimized campaign usage which we have collaborated with the company Pixis to execute with you, we hope that you both enjoyed it and learned from it. 

Thank you for your time.

avaus,"Finally, we can share the news! 🚨 We are expanding our performance marketing expertise with the appointment of Jens Hård. 

Welcome to the team as our Director of Performance and Omnichannel Marketing 👏

Who is Jens?

With deep expertise in digital marketing, data analytics, and AI-driven strategies, he’s adding 20 years of industry leadership to the Avaus team. His previous roles at Accenture and GroupM and his expertise in areas such as retail media, GTM strategies, and results-driven marketing have positioned him as a thought leader.

As marketing teams realize how important first-party data is to their overall marketing strategy, we have seen a growing need for strategic guidance in this area.

Early adopters are already reaping the benefits—our clients working with first-party data have seen CPA (Cost per Acquisition) drop by up to 20%.

“There is a paradigm shift in the media industry, moving from two decades of third-party data reliance to a future focused on first-party data. This shift will fuel marketing strategy, activation, and growth. Avaus is at the forefront of this transformation, helping brands leverage this change for growth.” says Jens Hård.

Johanna Andrén explains that the latest AI revolution has not only opened up people’s minds to test and learn, but also to understand that there is a leap to be made. Both in terms of productivity and quality.

But it all comes down to questions about processes, competences and getting people together rather than trying out all the new shiny things. 

There are a lot of productivity increases to be made in areas such as planning, briefing, content production and reporting. Two foundational steps that Johanna means are vital for all of those are to consolidate and standardize. Without mastering those, you will have a hard time actualizing those productivity gains.

👉 Full breakout session available now: https://lnkd.in/djUXEd84

Joakim Rönnblom explains that composable architectures allow you to combine different components and solutions to create more complex and flexible systems, rather than relying on a single monolithic platform.

This does not only increase flexibility but also reduces risks.

You should also prioritize collaborating cross-functionally, especially between sales/marketing and technical teams, to identify opportunities to leverage composable architectures and maximize the potential of data, automation and AI. 

Joakim advises everyone to start by defining clear business objectives and use cases, then create a detailed roadmap for implementing composable architectures in a step-by-step manner with input from technical teams.

Hanna Kollberg shares learnings from their content automation pilot.

Watch this (and other) sessions here: https://lnkd.in/djUXEd84 💡✨

It’s easy to think about the technical side and all those requirements, but the people side is equally important (and easily forgotten). Content automation means a new way of working with briefing, proofing, insights etc. And when a company can handle both the technical and the people side, the discussion about content automation can really come to life. 👌

Content automation has a potential improvement on EBITA with 2 to 7%, but it's also about meeting the customers' expectations. A vast majority of customers expect more tailored content, and if a company wants to stay relevant, those needs have to be met. 

Hanna advises everyone interested to start, to take on a use case approach and start small, end to end.

Watch this (and many more) recorded sessions here: https://lnkd.in/djUXEd84 💡✨

The content landscape is changing rapidly. Demands for content to drive personalization are skyrocketing while budgets are tightening.

At the same time, teams struggle to seamlessly deploy content to drive engagement and results. 

Jakob Bartholdy underlines that content needs to be findable and reusable, while you also need to turn assets into customer experiences that engage in the correct touch points to drive ROI. Generative AI can help deliver on this demand, transforming your marketing content and increasing the number of variations. 

Gen AI delivers a fundamental change, but what does this mean in the content supply chain? Jakob identifies several key challenges such as time-consuming review and approvals, inability to find and re-use assets but also low adherence to brand standards.

While gen AI can help you generate more content, you still need to manage this content, governance and approvals. Something that can be handled via systems such as Adobe GenStudio.

6sense,"Five lessons in B2B sales coaching from your favorite industry pros, heard on the #RevenueMakers podcast ⬇️

1️⃣ Sam Gong, SVP of Marketing at WorkSpan
BDRs stand on the front line of AI adoption in B2B sales. Be mindful that BDR and sales teams need continuous development and support to effectively adapt to the latest tech and changing market dynamics.

2️⃣ Chris Lee, Chief Revenue Officer at interos.ai
People buy from people they trust and know. Building strong connections and trust can greatly enhance B2B sales success, and it's crucial for sellers to connect with customers on a personal level.

3️⃣ Gabrielle “GB” Blackwell, Account Executive at Common Room
It’s important to have a clear strategy before investing in sales development and aligning BDRs with specific account executives. This strategic alignment is crucial for effective sales coaching, as it ensures that coaching efforts are directed towards well-defined goals and objectives. 

4️⃣ Ernest Owusu, Director of Sales Development Transformation at 6sense
Hire BDRs with intrinsic motivation, grit, curiosity, and conscientiousness. These are essential traits of top-performing BDRs and can be nurtured through effective coaching strategies.

5️⃣ Nick Cegelski, Co-Founder of 30 Minutes to President's Club
No one enjoys cold calls — not the seller making them, nor the prospect receiving them. But with the right coaching, strategies, and tools to warm them up, outbound calls can be one of the most effective ways to build your team's pipeline.

1️⃣ Failing to set clear goals.
What do you really want to accomplish? Increase pipeline, improve customer satisfaction, or reduce costs? Without clear goals, it’s difficult to measure the success of your AI initiative. 

2️⃣ Missing the right data for AI implementation.
AI needs data to generate insights. This data can come from a variety of sources, such as your CRM, marketing automation platform, and website analytics. If you don’t have the right data, your AI implementation won’t be successful. 

3️⃣ Not having the right team or technology.
Implementing AI can be a complex process. Make sure you have the resources you need, like support from operations, before you get started.

4️⃣ Focusing on too many use cases at once.
It’s tempting to try to implement AI in all areas of your sales process at once. It’s better to focus on a few key use cases and wait for successful results before expanding to other areas.

6sense,"Nothing stings more for marketers than generating demand only to see it go unworked by sales. On the flip side, sales teams face an uphill battle, juggling limited time and resources while prioritizing the leads/accounts they think are most promising, rather than the ones marketing serves up. The disconnect creates a “dead zone,” where opportunities slip through the cracks, prospects lose interest, and revenue potential is lost. 
 
But what if there were a way to bridge this gap without overloading your team? 
 
Generative AI is transforming how revenue teams work. It steps in where BDRs don’t have the capacity and ensures no demand goes untouched. It’s not about replacing the human effort — it's about amplifying it. 
 
AI is not the future — it is happening now. If you’re ready to turn your dead zones into growth opportunities, it’s time to bring AI into the fold.

A sneak peek at takeaways from this episode:

➡️ Analyze past buying journeys to identify patterns that signal when an account is in-market. Use AI models to forecast and prioritize account engagement based on these insights. 

➡️ Target high-potential accounts proactively. Provide personalized content, event invitations, and access to subject matter experts before formal engagement begins.

6sense,"Is using more AI part of your 2025 go-to-market strategy, or your New Year’s resolution? Either way, try these five tips for integrating AI into your existing sales processes:

1️⃣ Set clear goals for your AI implementation. Do you want to increase sales, improve customer satisfaction, or reduce costs?

️2️⃣ Determine the data you need from sources such as your CRM, marketing automation platform, and website analytics. Then you can start collecting and organizing your data. Be sure to prioritize the AI use cases that are most relevant to you and your business goals (not all AI use cases are created equal).

3️⃣ Account for the time and cost of implementing AI before you get started. You should have a clear idea of the return on marketing investment (ROMI) that you can expect from your AI implementation.

4️⃣ Understand the potential of AI in sales. AI can help you automate tasks, generate insights, and improve your sales performance, but it is not a replacement for human sales reps.

6sense,"⚡ POWER UP: ABM & CONTENT STRATEGY ⚡

Content marketing pros Adam Kaiser and Pete Lorenco from PathFactory revealed their secrets to crafting best-in-class ABM content strategies for every step of the sales funnel! Here are four key steps:

1️⃣ Create your Ideal Customer Profile (ICP). 

Try this short-cut: Use an AI-powered platform to crunch historical data and buyer behavior to tell your revenue team which accounts are likely to be a match.

2️⃣ Group your prospects and customers. Assign them to audiences to create personalized content.

Pro tip: If you’re working on campaigns to reengage, consider grouping prospects by lost opportunities, postponed or stuck opportunities, or dormant leads.

3️⃣ Put your audience first and create content that speaks to their specific needs – not your organization's interests.

Reminder: It’s not just about what you say — it’s how and where you say it. Consider formats and channels that your audience engages with.  

4️⃣ Be an expert in your customers, understanding their needs, goals, and pain inside and out. 

How? Just listen. Prospect and customer feedback is a content goldmine that tells you what your audiences need to know.

That's not exactly true. Nick Cegelski, Co-Founder of 30 Minutes to President's Club, has the data to back it up – plus the strategies to warm up your cold calls and book more meetings.

Here are two pro tips Nick shared in a recent webinar with Ernest Owusu: 

1️⃣ Target accounts and individuals with the highest probability of purchasing, using predictive tools to identify buying intent signals. You'll get higher response rates and ROI than calling random leads.

2️⃣ Start with a “tailored permission opener” which opens with the context of the call — owning that it's a cold call (but a well-researched one) and getting permission to make your pitch. Disarming prospects with honesty will differentiate you from ordinary telemarketers.

The right research and tools can turn your outbound calls into meaningful, results-driven conversations.

6sense,"🔥 Are traditional ""hot leads"" really that hot?

Sales leaders, this episode of the Science of B2B is for you! But hey, if you're in holiday mode and not ready to think about work yet, save this post for later – no judgment here.

Kerry Cunningham continues the conversation about intent data, focusing on how sales teams can better use signals from accounts without relying on ""hot leads.""

Here are three key takeaways for your team:

1️⃣ Look beyond form fills.
Only 20-30% of buying team members will fill out forms. As for the rest, detect their anonymous engagement through website traffic and intent signals.

2️⃣ Empower your buyers.
Provide high-value content, connect buyers with subject matter experts, and invite them to relevant events — all without attaching strings. Remember: the goal is to support their decision-making process and build preference for your brand.

3️⃣ Proactively engage the whole buying team.
Use tools like LinkedIn or name databases to identify potential buyers within engaged accounts. Focus on delivering content directly to them, even if they haven’t expressed personal interest yet.

6sense,"Simplicity will be the ultimate success strategy in 2025. The smartest marketers will focus on actionable AI, efficient processes, and delivering results that matter. Here’s how I see marketing evolving in the year ahead:

1️⃣ AI Will Supercharge Impact — With the Right Data
AI will make marketers more efficient and effective, but only when it’s combined with contextual first-party data. Without that, it will produce more generic content that adds to the noise B2B buyers are faced with. With the right data and context, though, AI will deliver real-time insights that enable marketers to execute campaigns with precision, speed, and confidence. 

2️⃣ AI Agents Will Redefine BDR Success
AI agents will transform the BDR role in 2025, helping prioritize accounts, personalize outreach, and improve efficiency. By accelerating their learning curve, BDRs will master AE-level skills faster, advancing their careers while meeting their goals more consistently. 

3️⃣ Campaigns Will Optimize in Real-Time
Waiting weeks to adjust campaigns is a thing of the past. With AI-powered, data-backed insights, campaigns will adapt instantly to buyer behavior, ensuring messaging stays relevant and impactful in real-time.  

4️⃣ Brand-to-Demand Will Be a Strategic Priority
Marketers will prioritize delivering valuable, consistent brand experiences that create trust and engagement throughout the buyer’s journey. The 2024 B2B Buyer Experience Report reveals that 84% of buyers begin their journey with the vendor they ultimately choose. That tells us that building brand awareness is about so much more than visibility — it’s about creating demand by equipping buyers with the insights, information, and confidence they need long before they’re ready to engage with sales. 

5️⃣ Personalization Will Scale
In 2025, the days of generic outreach will be over. AI agents will use contextual data to create tailored, relevant experiences across channels, building stronger connections with buyers without sacrificing efficiency. 

6️⃣ AI Agents Will Multiply Impact of Events
In 2025, AI agents will revolutionize event strategies, acting as ""event multipliers"" to maximize pipeline impact. From pre-event engagement to real-time insights and post-event follow-up, AI agents will streamline planning, boost attendee engagement, and ensure every interaction drives measurable results.",2024-12-19 16:25:50.928999901,79,5,5,2024-12,simplicity ultimate success strategy smartest marketer focus actionable ai efficient process delivering result matter here see marketing evolving year ahead ai supercharge impact right data ai make marketer efficient effective combined contextual firstparty data without produce generic content add noise bb buyer faced right data context though ai deliver realtime insight enable marketer execute campaign precision speed confidence ai agent redefine bdr success ai agent transform bdr role helping prioritize account personalize outreach improve efficiency accelerating learning curve bdrs master aelevel skill faster advancing career meeting goal consistently campaign optimize realtime waiting week adjust campaign thing past aipowered databacked insight campaign adapt instantly buyer behavior ensuring messaging stay relevant impactful realtime brandtodemand strategic priority marketer prioritize delivering valuable consistent brand experience create trust engagement throughout buyer journey bb buyer experience report reveals buyer begin journey vendor ultimately choose tell u building brand awareness much visibility creating demand equipping buyer insight information confidence need long theyre ready engage sale personalization scale day generic outreach ai agent use contextual data create tailored relevant experience across channel building stronger connection buyer without sacrificing efficiency ai agent multiply impact event ai agent revolutionize event strategy acting event multiplier maximize pipeline impact preevent engagement realtime insight postevent followup ai agent streamline planning boost attendee engagement ensure every interaction drive measurable result,0.20714285714285716,positive,0

6sense,"What do you think Kerry Cunningham's favorite movie is? Guess in the comments! 

Kerry is back with a new episode of The Science of B2B! This time, he's taking on the longstanding sales and marketing friction around leads and intent data.

He shares this advice for sales teams:

➡️ Use intent data and anonymous signals to target accounts showing signs of being in-market, rather than waiting for individual leads to engage.

6sense,"Is it time for a Spotify Wrapped… for 6sense Revenue Makers?

A bit over a year ago we set out to create a podcast for our audience to help educate, entertain, and inform around all things Revenue. And here we are, 50 episodes later. CRAZY! It's been fun and I know I've learned so much along the way. Huge shout out to my partner in crime in this, Saima Rashid, for enduring far too many dad jokes and bad impersonations.

As we hit the milestone of 50 episodes, we took a moment to reflect on what resonated most with our listeners. From redefining cold calling to nailing down Ideal Customer Profiles (ICP) to the art of attribution, it’s clear that some strategies have become staples for success.

One key takeaway: marketing influences 100% of closed deals if you’re doing it right. Whether through personalized Account-Based Marketing (ABM), refining your ICP to focus on the right accounts, or understanding the customer journey with clear attribution, it’s all about turning insights into action.

Catch this milestone episode to hear what we’ve learned so far—and let us know what you’d like to hear next. We’re just getting started!

6sense,"Parenthood is full of revelations, but one I didn’t expect was how much I’d learn about my own career from my son. 

In this Fast Company article, I reflect on what it’s been like to see both of us start our careers as BDRs — separated by a generation. From the tools and strategies used to the timeless skills that still define success in sales, it’s been fascinating to see how much has changed and what has stayed the same. 

Here’s my big takeaway: The core traits of a successful BDR remain constant. Resilience and grit are still non-negotiable, but modern tools give BDRs the power to amplify their impact beyond what we could do way back when. Far from replacing the human touch, technology has elevated the role of the BDR and created new opportunities for those who embrace its potential.

Ali has completed all four certifications: 6sense Next-Gen Sales, Fundamentals of Next-Gen Marketing, 6sense Administrator, and 6sense Digital Advertiser. 

""Taking the trainings has empowered me to drive impactful campaigns, optimize workflows, and deliver measurable results that support both immediate goals and long-term business growth,"" she said.

Here's how Ali is using 6sense and her certification training as Senior ABM Manager at Extreme Networks:

➡️ Driving more personalized and data-driven ABM strategies, which aligns with Ali's goal of expanding multi-channel engagement within her programs.

➡️ Using intent data and predictive analytics to better identify high-value accounts, tailor content to their specific needs, and improve collaboration with sales and operations teams.

➡️ Applying best practices for targeted digital campaigns that maximize ROI through a full-fledged journey map, versus hitting all accounts at one time with one single message.

Her 6sense certification advice? ""Focus on how the skills can be applied to your specific role or challenges. Don't try to start with everything, but focus on the one that will be most impactful for your role today,"" she shared.

Buyers average 187 interactions with potential vendors during their buying journey, according to the latest research in our 2024 B2B Buyer Experience Report. So, you can't get a clear picture by only measuring the first and last touch, or even a few interactions in between.

6sense,"‼️ The average turnover rate of sales reps is a whopping 35% ‼️

The cost of replacing an employee ranges from half to 2x their salary. But the true cost goes beyond numbers — it’s deeply personal.

Every unanswered email or unreturned call feels like rejection. Over time, it can take a psychological toll that chips away at their confidence and motivation, making it harder to approach each new prospect with enthusiasm.

Then there's the sheer volume of tedious, manual work. 🫠

Hours spent on account research, data entry, and drafting personalized outreach is overwhelming. It leaves little time for *actually* selling and having meaningful conversations with prospects.

The result? Burnout.

6sense,"🎯 Level Up Your Account-Based Digital Advertising 🎯 

Thrilled to have co-hosted an insightful webinar alongside Kyle Dugan from 6sense and Gautam Chatur from Entegra, where we explored advanced strategies for account-based digital advertising. A big thank you to everyone who joined us live and our behind-the-scenes master of all things webinar, Victoria Squire 👏  

Key takeaways from our discussion: 

✅ Segmentation Drives Success: 
- Start with not-yet-in-market targeting to build brand awareness among ICP-aligned accounts 
- Leverage in-market signals to focus on audiences closer to conversion 

✅ Sophisticated Campaign Tactics: 
- Utilize tools like DV360 and The Trade Desk for custom job function/title/seniority overlays 
- Optimize media CPA goals to what's meaningful (and can provide conversion volume) **without** gating content
- Stage-based LinkedIn campaigns with shared Campaign Group budgets based on in-market stage provide efficiency while maintaining effectiveness
- Value-based bidding on Google Ads are game-changers for optimization and efficiency; use bid modifiers or conversion value multipliers when a target account performs the actions you want from paid search

✅ The Role of First-Party Data: 
- Build trust and relevance with data-driven messaging tailored to your audience's needs based on the stage they are in 
- Use LinkedIn's Conversions API and offline conversion imports to enhance performance and reduce signal loss
- Use content syndication sparingly on low funnel accounts to fill out your buying committee, enabling your sales team to multithread with opted in decision makers and influencers

✅ Holistic Media Strategy: 
- Combine DSAs (Dynamic Search Ads) for new keyword discovery with PMAX campaigns to capture incremental value 
- Adjust media targets based on 6sense’s Company Detail API or Customer Match segments to drive conversions and meet business goals 
- Craft a matrix of leading indicators that generally result in business outcome success and back into platform-appropriate conversion values and volume 

The synergy between a structured ABM strategy and data-driven execution is powerful. It was incredible to showcase how Entegra leveraged these tools to achieve measurable success. #ABM #DigitalAdvertising #6sense #Webinar #B2BMarketing

6sense,"Do you give a $%@#!? 

Pardon the language, but this week's Revenue Makers with Jen Allen-Knuth tackled just that, from a sales lens...

Great outreach is ultimately about understanding what matters to your prospect.

One of the best insights Jen shared is how she approaches busy executives. Instead of leading with a generic introduction or a templated pitch, she digs into their priorities and potential challenges, crafting a message that speaks directly to their world. When you can highlight a challenge they might face and offer a thoughtful perspective, you’re not just another email in their inbox—you’re someone worth their time.

Do the research, anticipate their challenges, and position yourself as a problem-solver, not just another vendor.

As I reflect on this theme, here are three things I’m particularly grateful for: 

1️⃣ Seeing our customers thrive 

Being part of our customers’ success is a privilege I never take for granted. Whether it’s helping teams hit ambitious revenue targets, creating efficiencies that free up their time, or driving transformative results, I’m immensely proud of the value we’re delivering every day. Recognition like being named a leader in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for ABM Platforms for the fourth consecutive year is a great reminder that we’re on the right track.  
 
To our team: thank you for the ingenuity, focus, and relentless effort that goes into ensuring we exceed expectations. To our customers: thank you for your trust and partnership. Together, we’re achieving incredible things. 

2️⃣ In-person moments that spark innovation 

A few weeks ago, I had the opportunity to spend time with more than 400 6sensors from across the globe at our tech offsite in India. Face-to-face moments like these — whether casual conversations or deep strategic discussions — are where the magic happens. They remind me of the power of human connection and the creativity it inspires. 

To everyone reading this: make time for in-person interactions with your teams, customers, and partners. It’s the shot in the arm we need to inspire big ideas and breakthrough thinking, and I’m incredibly grateful for these moments. 

3️⃣ The opportunity to help lead a revolution in B2B 

We’re living through one of the most transformative eras in business, driven by advancements like AI agents. These agents are catalysts for a completely new paradigm of work. By freeing us from mundane tasks, AI agents allow us to focus deeply on strategy, creativity, and connection. They enable us to work smarter, deliver personalized experiences at scale, and elevate what’s possible in our roles. I’m grateful to be part of this seismic shift — and to be helping others navigate it to achieve real results and reinvent their relationships with their work. 

To our customers, partners, and my fellow 6sensors: Thank you. Your trust, collaboration, and curiosity make it all possible. Let’s keep building, innovating, and making a difference together. 

What are you grateful for this month?

6sense,"Buyers won’t talk to sales until they’re ready. If you reach out early, you’ll be ignored.

The keys to winning more deals are understanding which accounts are in-market, maximizing your influence within the buying group during their research phase, and knowing when to reach out.

What’s needed to effect this change? Intent data and predictive analytics. 

Even though buyers aren’t raising their hand, they’re still doing their due diligence. Buyers are: 
➡️ Searching keywords about their pain points 
➡️ Reading content on your website (that’s not gated – if it’s hidden behind a form, most won’t see it)
➡️ Comparing products and services on third-party review sites 
➡️ Engaging with content related to their needs on social media

6sense,"Friendly reminder: Personalization isn’t just inserting a “Hi [First Name]” tag in your email campaigns and calling it a day.

Here's what real personalization looks like: 

➡️ Delivering content relevant to where the buyer is in their journey.

➡️ Aligning messaging with the pain points and benefits that most align with a buyer’s interests. 

➡️ Reaching the audience through the right channels.

➡️ Timing your interactions perfectly — not too early, not too late.

True personalization requires knowing not just who you’re reaching out to, but also the concerns they have, based on their role and industry, their pain points, and more — a core feature of account-based marketing.

6sense,"Are you (or your pipeline) suffering from Signal Substitution Syndrome??

This week on The Science of B2B, Kerry Cunningham explains Signal Substitution Syndrome: a phenomenon where B2B marketers replace one data signal (like MQLs, intent data, or anonymous web traffic) with another, rather than integrating multiple signals.

Relying on one data signal independently just isn't effective – it leads to missed opportunities and lower conversion rates.

Kerry shares his research-backed strategy for a signal combination approach, using AI to integrate multiple useful signals that indicate when an account is truly in-market.

1. Condense your call blocks to 1-2 focused sessions per day

2. Treat cold calling like a workout - shut off email & slack when ""training""

3. Do it first thing in the morning, get the monkey off your back early 

4. Memorize your opener + value prop so you can focus on your delivery

5. Only positive self talk is allowed, even if you mess up (we all do) 

6. Stand up & own your space. I like to pace back & forth (get my steps in lol)

7. Do all your research + find contact info SEPARATE from your call blocks

6sense,"When developing your product positioning, ask yourself: how easily can customers see themselves in what you’re selling?

Consider structuring your messaging around how your customers think about and use your product. For example, you might communicate your product’s value through key features, specific audience personas, or aspirational goals—whatever helps them immediately connect with your solution.

Effective positioning goes beyond explaining your product. It aligns what you offer with what your customers are truly looking for.

6sense,"It's time to reevaluate your intro calls.

Research in our 2024 Buyer Experience Report shows that buyers have already done extensive research into your brand (and your competitors) by the time they talk to sales reps. 

Your first meeting should deliver an experience that feels insightful, valuable, and consultative. Spend less time talking about you, and more time on your prospect’s needs and goals.

Our own reps use the “Teach, Tailor, Take Control” approach for more successful first meetings. Try it out:

➡️ Teach: Establish your credibility as a trusted advisor by sharing educational insights that offer value right away. Come prepared with info on current industry trends, common challenges within your prospect’s industry, or best practices that top companies are implementing.  

➡️ Tailor: Use research and intent data to customize your presentation and address relevant pain points. Personalizing will help take you beyond surface-level discussions and focus on solutions that directly impact the prospect’s business goals. 

➡️ Take Control: Set a clear agenda from the start and guide your prospect through possible next steps. It’s less about pushing the prospect and more about leading them confidently through the process.

The key to success lies in tailoring the creative to your ICP and focusing on what resonates with your target accounts. Our recent “Dump Your Data Vendor” campaign was packed with humor and nostalgia, but it was the alignment with our ICP that made it impactful. 

In B2B, you don’t have to play it safe. Creativity can make a huge impact, but only when it’s guided by strategy. By following our framework, we ensured every effort—from targeting the right accounts to measuring real results—was anchored to what mattered most to our audience.

In this episode of #RevenueMakers,  Saima Rashid and I break down the five steps in 6sense’s ABM framework:
